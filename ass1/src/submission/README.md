# How to Use our Notebook
* First, please ensure that the config.json file is in the same folder as the notebook.
 This file has configuration information about the datasets we used in our submission and is required by our `pre-process()` function.
* Next, change the constants at the top of the notebook to the relevant filepaths for the datasets used in our submission.
##### The rest of the notebook is fairly well commented and should step through the rest. Most function definitions are at the top and should be run before any of them are used. Question specific code is found at the bottom. Question 4 is answered first because we use cross validation in questions 1, 2 and 5.
