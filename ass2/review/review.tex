\section*{Report 1 review}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discussion of literature is non-existent. The only reference which is not the datasets is to a blog post.
    \item more theoretical analysis everywhere 
    \item Always need to say what the numbers are (are the decimals in 3.2.1 accuracy? fscore? -- this occurs throughout)
    \item Need to explain why more often (why feature 83 and 30?)
    \item Using acronyms without explaining them (SGD), names of files, method names from specific implementations is extremely unhelpful (so are terminal screenshots)
    \item Use expected terminology, Figure 6 is a confusion matrix. SVC is sklearn terminology, its a SVM.
    \item Formatting problems are distracting 
    \item The number of decimal places in Table 2 is ridiculous, and why accuracy is a tuple is not clear
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Report 2 review}
This report presented an approach to text sentiment analysis which is based on sophisticated feature generation and selection. The approach to feature generation and selection presented in this report is well considered, and appears to be based on a robust statistical understanding of natural language processing. This is reflected in the strong performance of the final classifier. 

This report would benefit from more explanation of the theory behind the techniques. While the efficacy of the techniques is clear from the experimental data presented, it is not clear why this is the case. In particular, it would be good to include a discussion of why different classifiers had different performance with the selected features, and why the generated features result in strong model performance. Along these lines, this report would be improved by including a more comprehensive introduction to the feature generation techniques employed. In the reviewers' opinion, the assumption that readers are ``familiar with the basic theory of TF-IDF and n-gram vectorised representation of text'' is not reasonable, and failing to include a detailed discussion of this makes the remainder of the report less accessible. Additionally, including more references to literature would help guide a reader looking to explore the topics discussed here further.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Would benefit from more direct explanation at times
    \item Need to introduce TF-IDF and n-grams
    \item The relevance of much of the introduction is not clear
    \item more references 
    \item less figures
    \item Feature selection is cool
\end{itemize}
